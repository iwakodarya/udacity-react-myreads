# MyReads Project
This project is one of the projects of Udacity's React Nanodegree program. Some starter code was provided, including BooksAPI, HTML, CSS, icons. The work I did is in /starter/src folder. 

Core skills showcased here:
* React (useState, useEffect) for UX
* React-router-dom for browser navigation

To run the project: 
1. `npm install` to install dependencies
2. `npm start` to start the dev server
